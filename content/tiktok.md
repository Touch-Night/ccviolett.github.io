### 2. Letter from Lily

Dear CC, 

I’ve recently come to the realization that I have no natural social skills. I have a lot of trouble communicating, especially if there’s more than one other person involved in the conversation. Knowing what to say and when to say it is somehow really hard for me, so I frequently avoid situations where I have to talk to people. Since I’m female, and girls are supposed to be good at interpersonal skills, it just makes me that much more awkward.

I’m in my second year at a university, and while I could never give up my program, or my life in this city, I sometimes feel really isolated, and this bothers me. I live with two lovely roommates, who are good friends, but one is moving out soon, and the other one, like my family, has her own “issues” to deal with. I’ve joined a school club and met some people there, but it's only helped a little.

I’m also worried that my lack of social skills is preventing me from really growing up. Although I’m doing a part-time job now, finding jobs has been a problem, at least partly because I’m really not good at interviews. Also, I would someday like to think about dating. The first and last time someone asked me out (to watch a movie in his dorm room), I declined and told him all about my German class, because I mistakenly believed that he was very interested in studying German. Naturally, we didn’t get very far, and it was well after the fact that I realized his real intentions.

Now, at this point in my life, I really want some practical advice, nothing about “meeting the right person” or “coming out of my shell,” or ... I’m 20 years old and I’ve been this way my whole life.  I know I’m not likely to change radically any time soon. I’m just afraid that my life will go on like this.

    Yours sincerely, 
Lily

Dear Lily,

I am so sorry to here about that. Having trouble in socializing is really upset up. I can see that you are struggling to change yourself and you are really painful. After readding your letter, I have something to say to you. 

First, breaking the stereotype. You say 'girls are supposed to be good at interpersonal skills'. You even be more awkward due to this statement. But usually, this type of staments are always stereotype. It tags us, misleads us, imprisons us. Girls can be either good at interpersonal skills or not. Equally, everyone can be good at it or not. We don't need to be the same so the world can be different.

I think the main problem you have is that, you cannot accept yourself. You are confused due to the loneliness. You want to be the "good guys" other people defined instead of having courage to just be yourself. 

Have you ever think that maybe you don't need to change anyway. Maybe life that go on like is already a good life. Maybe loneliness is the gifted god gives you to prevent you from being hurt and someday you will not feel lonely when you find someone. Maybe extrovert has its advantage and introvent also has its incomparable advantage.

You don't need to change anything radically. You just need to adjust your mentality gradually. I think you will be better and better one day. Hope to receive your reply.

    Yours,
Liz
